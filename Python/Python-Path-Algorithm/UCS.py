    # some other functions here populate the graph, and randomly select three goal nodes.
#Now I am trying to implement a uniform-cost search (i.e. a BFS with a priority queue, guaranteeing a shortest path) which starts from a given node v, and returns a shortest path (in list form) to one of three goal node. By a goal node, I mean a node with the attribute is_goal set to true.

#This is my implementation:

def ucs(G, v):
    visited = set()                  # set of visited nodes
    visited.add(v)                   # mark the starting vertex as visited

    q.put((0, v))                    # add the starting node, this has zero *cumulative* cost

        dequeued_item = q.get()        
        current_node = dequeued_item[1]             # get node at top of queue
        current_node_priority = dequeued_item[0]    # get the cumulative priority for later

        if current_node.is_goal:                    # if the current node is the goal
            path_to_goal = [current_node]           # the path to the goal ends with the current node (obviously)
            prev_node = current_node                # set the previous node to be the current node (this will changed with each iteration)

            while prev_node != v:                   # go back up the path using parents, and add to path
                parent = parents[prev_node]
                path_to_goal.append(parent)   
                prev_node = parent

            path_to_goal.reverse()                  # reverse the path

                if child not in visited:            # if it is not visited
                    visited.add(child)              # mark it as visited
                    parents[child] = current_node   # set the current node as the parent of child
                    q.put((current_node_priority + edge.weight, child)) # and enqueue it with *cumulative* priority
